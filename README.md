# Load Balancer API

Load Balancer API implemented in GraphQL that provides a way to manage and control load balancers using GraphQL queries and mutations. Load Balancers are one subgraph of the Infratographer [federated API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/). The GraphQL API provides an efficient and precise data retrieval for the related compenents that are external to Load Balancers subgraph, such as [Tenants](https://github.com/infratographer/tenant-api) and [Locations](https://github.com/infratographer/location-api).

### Load Balancers

Load Balancers are the top level component managed by the load balancer API.  Load balancers are assigned to a tenant.

### Ports

Ports define the listening port of a load balancer. Ports share edges to load balancers and pools.

### Pools

Pools are a collection of origins. Pools are own by a tenant, and share an edge to ports. Pools can be assigned to multiple port and load balancer pairs.

### Origins

Origins define a backend service IP and port. Origins belong to a pool. Origins can have a weight from 0 to 100, these weights are a relative to one another in a given pool. A wieght of 0 means the origin is disabled.
